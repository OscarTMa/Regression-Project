## Description
Regression is a fundamental supervised machine learning technique used to predict continuous numerical outcomes based on input features. This project focuses on applying regression to [The Boston house-price data of Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.] using a structured dataset. The analysis is designed to provide insights into the relationships between input features and the target variable while also delivering an accurate predictive model.

## Key Concepts Covered
1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Understand the data through visualization, summary statistics, and correlation analysis.

2.Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Transform and encode categorical variables.
- Standardize or normalize numerical features.

3.Modeling and Evaluation

- Experiment with different regression techniques (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
- Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²) to evaluate model performance.

4.Feature Importance and Interpretability

- Understand which features influence predictions the most.
- Visualize model predictions versus actual values.
  
## Project Goals
1.Build a robust regression model to predict [target variable, e.g., house prices].                                      
2.Explore and visualize patterns in the data.                                                 
3.Highlight practical insights for stakeholders, such as the most influential factors affecting the target variable.                                          

## Technologies Used
- Python for data processing and modeling.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and metrics.
